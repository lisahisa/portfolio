                    <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Lisa and I am a college student studying graphic design, 
                        aiming to use my creative knowledge to make a positive impact on the world. 
                        In my eyes, successful design comes from the integration of thorough research and creative problem-solving. 
                        A visual solution doesn’t solely come from a measure of aesthetics—what’s also expected is the 
                        designer’s willingness to understand the issue at large and push the project to its full potential. 
                        My qualities of curious experimentation, continuous efforts for improvement, and wish for developing 
                        everlasting relationships get me far to distribute design solutions that will benefit the greater good.</p>

                  <h5 class="stepname">Research</h5>
                  <p>Before going into creative development, research is conducted to understand the project better. Research can be divided into two sections: literary research—compiling information about the client, industry, and target audience—and visual research—drawing inspiration from other successful design solutions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="two">
                  <h4 class="stepnum">2</h4>
                  <hr class="numline2"/>
                  <h5 class="stepname">Ideate</h5>
                  <p>The ideation process begins with a “brain dump,” where the problem is tackled from various perspectives. This typically takes the form of mind maps and rough thumbnail sketches, exploring a diverse range of solutions and always referencing the research that was conducted.</p>

              </div>
              <div class="my-process-steps">

                  <hr class="numline3"/>
                  <h5 class="stepname">Develop</h4>
                    <p>The numerous solutions that were created in the Ideate step are then narrowed down to a single direction, determining the best option that achieves the project’s objectives. At this stage, decisions about color usage, typography, layouts, and imagery are made based on the visual research, visualizing how the final result could look.</p>

                <div class="four">
                  <h4 class="stepnum">4</h4>
                  <hr class="numline4"/>
                  <h5 class="stepname">Revise</h5>
                  <p>Once a testable prototype is developed, it goes through a series of checkpoints, receiving feedback from the client as well as user groups. The design is refined and finalized until it meets the project’s objectives and satisfies the client’s needs.</p>
